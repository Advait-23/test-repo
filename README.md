# Git Collaboration Assignment

## What We Learned

We learned how to use Git and GitHub to collaborate on a coding project.  
We started by creating a public GitHub repository and adding a README file.  
We both worked on separate branches (`advait-branch`, `teammate-branch`, etc.), each containing different code files to simulate real-world teamwork.  
Each member pushed their changes only to their own branch, not to `main`.

Later, we used pull requests to merge all branches into the `main` branch, following proper version control and collaboration practices.  
This helped us understand branching, commits, pushing, pull requests, and merging in a hands-on way.  
It was our first time doing an end-to-end collaborative workflow using Git entirely via the command line.

Total branches: 4  
Final result: All changes successfully merged into `main`.
